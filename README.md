If the customer continues then amount is calculated and then quantity is reduced from the stock and everything is appended to lists for further printing of bill.  If new stock arrives then we check whether the product is available in our stock if so we will add the new stock into old stock or if it is a new product which is not present in our stock then we create new id for it and we add into our stock.
